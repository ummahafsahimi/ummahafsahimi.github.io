### DevOps Practitioner | Operational Engineer | Technical Project Manager

Hi, I'm a DevOps Engineer who loves turning manual processes into automated solutions. I work with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins to build reliable infrastructure that scales. Browse my projects to see how I approach real-world DevOps challenges.

## Projects
- **AWS/Terraform Infrastructure** – Production-grade IaC for VPC, EC2, EKS, ECR.
- **Kubernetes Deployments** – Helm charts, GitOps workflows, RBAC, Ingress.
- **Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines** – Automated builds, tests, Docker images, security scans.
- **Python Automation** – EC2/EKS health checks, backups, monitoring, notifications.

- **Project: Website Monitoring and Recovery with Python** -

I wrote a Python script with which I can monitor my application website. It can access my Linode server and check my application status.
If there is any server connection issue, it will send a notification to my email
If any connection issue, it can restart the container and fix the issue.
 

#### The tech stack for the project:
Jenkins: Open-source automation server to deploy versions.
PostgreSQL: Open-source object-relational database to store the version numbers.
pgAdmin: PostgreSQL administration tool.
Grafana: Data visualization tool.
Linux

What I have learned:
How to create Linode server, SSH into it, install docker there and run nginx container
How to access the Linode server on Web UI using the Linode IP address/DNS.
How to authenticate gmail in a python script using SMTPLIB module, and send emails.
How to set Environment Variables in the Pycharm Editor.
How to get notification in a gmail account, and use it in the case of any server connection/failure issues

- **Deploy application to AWS EKS via Ansible** –

Ansible Capstone Project- Deploying application to Kubernetes (EKS cluster)
Link: https://gitlab.com/my-capstone-projects-devops/ansible-demo-deploy-application-to-kubernetes-eks.git

First EKS Cluster and VPCS have been created using IaC (Terraform) [Check Terraform provisioning files in the eks BRANCH in this repo].
Then, I configured that AWS EKS cluster using Ansible. An Nginx deployment and service have been deployed to the cluster
through an Ansible playbook.

#### The tech stack for the project:
Ansible
Jenkins
Terraform
AWS EKS
Docker
Python
Git &
Linux

I learned the following from this project:
How to use the kubernetes.core.k8s module from the Ansible documentation, along with its
prerequisites (python3, pyYAML, kubernetes, and jsonpatch).
How to create a new namespace in an EKS cluster and deploy an application into that namespace.
How to generate and update a kubeconfig file to enable Ansible to connect to the EKS cluster.
How to set environment variables required for the Kubernetes module to function correctly.



- **Monitoring Stack** – Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
